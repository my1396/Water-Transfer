# Water Transfer

To-do list:

- [ ] check performance measures' baseline in classcification literature
- [ ] merge eastern and central line; train model using data before 2014 [MY]
- [ ] run eastern and central separately [MY]
  - [ ] eastern before and including 2013
  - [ ] central before and including 2014



Issue: False Negative is high due to inbalanced data. 85% False and 15% True.

Fix: try to apply class.weights, adjust threshold, etc.
